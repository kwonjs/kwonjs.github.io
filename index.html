					<span class="bio-intro">Hi y'all! I'm <strong>Jenny</strong>, I use <strong>they/them</strong> pronouns and I am based in the ⛅ foggy city of San Francisco ⛅. I am a <strong>graphics reporter</strong> (read: <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2023/covid-bay-area-wastewater/">front-end developer</a>, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2024/ai-bay-area">designer</a>, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2024/public-toilets-sf/">data reporter</a>, occasional <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2024/sf-bird-migration/">illustrator</a>) for <strong><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/jenny-kwon/">The San Francisco Chronicle</a></strong>.</span></p>
					<p class="hidden-content">
						Prior to working at The Chronicle, I interned at <a href = "https://www.seattletimes.com">The Seattle Times</a> as a graphics intern during Summer 2022 and the <a href = "https://www.sfpublicpress.org">San Francisco Public Press</a> during Summer 2021 as a data journalism intern, creating graphics and helping co-report/research stories related to health and housing. While my first official data journalism stint (and brief foray into feature writing and copy editing) was in Spring 2021 with <a href = "https://www.infonile.org">InfoNile</a>, a geodata journalism initiative based in Kampala, Uganda, I did exploratory data analysis and research on child welfare-related data for the <a href="https://journalism.berkeley.edu/why-berkeley/our-work/irp/">Investigative Reporting Program</a> (UC Berkeley School of Journalism) and open source intelligence (OSINT) reserach on wildfire effects and health worker discrimination for the <a href="https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/programs-and-initiatives/health-human-rights-program/">Human Rights Center</a> (UC Berkeley School of Law). From 2022 through 2024, I volunteered and served as a volunteer lead at the Asian American Journalism Association Conference. 
						<br><br>
						I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I majored in <a href = "https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/public-health-ba/curriculum/">Public Health</a> and minored in <a href = "https://journalism.berkeley.edu/programs/summer-minor-program/">Journalism</a>, <a href = "https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-minor">Data Science</a> and <a href = "https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gpp/">Global Poverty & Practice</a>. My passions lie in art; <a href = "https://www.sinsinvalid.org/blog/10-principles-of-disability-justice">disability justice</a>; the prison-military industrial complex (and how academia plays a role in this); LGBTQIA+ identity and rights, AANHPI (Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander) justice; big tech, ethics and policy and the intersections of all of these topics.
					</p>
					<button class="toggle-button" id="about-toggle">▶ Click to read more lore about me!</button>
					<!-- On campus, I did public health-specific reporting with and copy-edited for <a href = "https://pha.berkeley.edu/">the Public Health Advocate</a>, worked as a data journalist on <a href = "https://dailycal-projects.tumblr.com/">the Daily Californian's Projects team</a> and designed for <a href = "https://therightsstuff.org/">The Rights Stuff</a> (check out their <a href = "https://issuu.com/rightsstuff/docs/the_rights_stuff_-_spring_2020_issue">Spring '20 issue</a> - I designed the cover!) and <a href = "https://bpr.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Political Review</a>. 
					<br><br>
					Outside of designing graphics or layouts, fiddling with D3 or reporting, I served as a student coordinator and web designer/developer for <a href = "https://aapihrg.wordpress.com/">AAPIHRG</a>, or the Asian American & Pacific Islander Health Research Group, mentoring students on their research projects on AAPI-related health issues. I engaged in human-centered design as <a href = "https://fungfellows.berkeley.edu/fellows/2020-21-health-track/">a Health + Tech Fung Fellow</a>, learning how to conduct user interviews and engage in rapid prototyping, feedback and iteration. I was a also former research assistant at <a href = "https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/programs-projects/tech/investigations-lab">the Human Rights Investigative Lab</a> at the Human Rights Center, where I helped fact-check and collect data for various projects on health and human rights-related issues.  -->

					<br><br>
					Outside of work, I love learning languages - I can speak some Spanish and Korean, and I'm currently learning Japanese, ASL (American Sign Language) and Mandarin (let us yap about language learning apps!). I'm also diving into the world of electronic music production and curating experimental EDM Spotify playlists on the regular.

						<p><img class = "article-picture" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwonjs/kwonjs.github.io/main/images/covid-wastewater-dashboard.gif">The Chronicle is using wastewater surveillance to track the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Bay Area. Due to the scaling back of virus tracking efforts nationwide, scientists and public health experts — including those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — have turned to monitoring the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 particles found in wastewater at sewage treatment plants as a more dependable metric for community-level infection rates. This tracker pulls data daily and  displays data on the most recent and historic levels of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations at 12 Bay Area wastewater plants using WastewaterSCAN's API.

						<p><img class = "article-picture" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwonjs/kwonjs.github.io/main/images/bird-migration.gif">From as far as Alaska, massive flocks of birds leave their breeding grounds as fall weather portends the arrival of frigid temperatures and the loss of their best food sources. The journey south is a long one — thousands of miles for many species. Some will travel all the way to South America, where the warmer weather means food is plentiful.<br><br>But there are havens along the way, rich habitats still lush with fish and insects to fuel their trek along the Pacific Coast. And for many species of birds, few havens in California are more important than the San Francisco Bay Area.<br><br>
						I spearheaded the design and visual layout of this story, conducted data analysis and visualization of bird migratory pathways and provided scientific encyclopedia-style illustrations in collaboration with data reporter Christian Leonard.<br><br>

						<p><img class = "article-picture" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwonjs/kwonjs.github.io/main/images/fireshistory-preview.png">In recent years, California's wildfires have seemed ever more apocalyptic. Huge swaths of forest have been wiped out, forcing thousands to flee and choking many more with smoke. But here's a fact that may seem surprising: Even more of the California landscape used to be on fire. Before the 1800s, when Europeans flooding into California outlawed fires set by Native Americans, at least 4.5 million acres — and sometimes up to 12 million acres — burned in California every year, according to UC Berkeley researchers.<br><br>That figure has only one modern equivalent: 2020. That year, California wildfires burned over 4.3 million acres  — more than double the state's previous record. <br><br>

An artist of national consciousness, Eyayu incorporates both the symbolism from these bodies of water and indigenous aesthetics into his paintings and collages. His art is characterized by contrasting themes like traditionality versus modernity and the organic versus the artificial, aiming to raise awareness of the culture of  Lake Tana and the Blue Nile’s lakeside communities and the environmental issues they face. </p>
