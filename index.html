					Hi y'all! I'm <strong>Jenny</strong> and I use they/them pronouns. Currently, I'm a graphics reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle! I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I majored in <a href = "https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/public-health-ba/curriculum/">Public Health</a> and minored in <a href = "https://journalism.berkeley.edu/programs/summer-minor-program/">Journalism</a>, <a href = "https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-minor">Data Science</a> and <a href = "https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gpp/">Global Poverty & Practice</a>. My passions lie in art; <a href = "https://www.sinsinvalid.org/blog/10-principles-of-disability-justice">disability justice</a>; the prison-military industrial complex (and how academia plays a role in this); LGBTQIA+ identity and rights, AANHPI (Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander) justice; big tech, ethics and policy and the intersections of all of these topics.<br><br>
					<!-- Prior to working at The Chronicle, I interned at <a href = "https://www.seattletimes.com">The Seattle Times</a> as a graphics intern during Summer 2022 and the <a href = "https://www.sfpublicpress.org">San Francisco Public Press</a> during Summer 2021 as a data journalism intern, creating graphics and helping co-report/research stories related to health and housing. On campus, I did public health-specific reporting with and copy-edited for <a href = "https://pha.berkeley.edu/">the Public Health Advocate</a>, worked as a data journalist on <a href = "https://dailycal-projects.tumblr.com/">the Daily Californian's Projects team</a> and designed for <a href = "https://therightsstuff.org/">The Rights Stuff</a> (check out their <a href = "https://issuu.com/rightsstuff/docs/the_rights_stuff_-_spring_2020_issue">Spring '20 issue</a> - I designed the cover!) and <a href = "https://bpr.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Political Review</a>. 
					<br><br>
					Outside of designing graphics or layouts, fiddling with D3 or reporting, I served as a student coordinator and web designer/developer for <a href = "https://aapihrg.wordpress.com/">AAPIHRG</a>, or the Asian American & Pacific Islander Health Research Group, mentoring students on their research projects on AAPI-related health issues. I engaged in human-centered design as <a href = "https://fungfellows.berkeley.edu/fellows/2020-21-health-track/">a Health + Tech Fung Fellow</a>, learning how to conduct user interviews and engage in rapid prototyping, feedback and iteration. I was a also former research assistant at <a href = "https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/programs-projects/tech/investigations-lab">the Human Rights Investigative Lab</a> at the Human Rights Center, where I helped fact-check and collect data for various projects on health and human rights-related issues.  -->

					Fun facts: I love learning languages - I can speak some Spanish and Korean, and I'm currently trying to learn ASL (American Sign Language). I'm also very interested in electronic music production and run a regularly updated Spotify playlist called <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1xhTWESvAZj3SxkXGrd5ut?si=8rTfZ_BDT7aoAlhEv29vLg">slide into my E'DM's</a>.

						<p><img class = "article-picture" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwonjs/kwonjs.github.io/main/images/covid-wastewater-tracker.gif">The Chronicle is using wastewater surveillance to track the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Bay Area. Due to the scaling back of virus tracking efforts nationwide, scientists and public health experts — including those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — have turned to monitoring the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 particles found in wastewater at sewage treatment plants as a more dependable metric for community-level infection rates. This tracker pulls data daily and  displays data on the most recent and historic levels of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations at 12 Bay Area wastewater plants using WastewaterSCAN's API.

Readers can filter by “type” of restroom (for instance, whether the restroom is within a BART train station) and filter ones that are wheelchair accessible, open 24 hours or staffed. They can also click on each point to see locations and hours and days that the restrooms are open. I compiled data from multiple sources, confirmed and revised information, including locations, availability and accessibility, with multiple public and private sources,  developed the map and did background reporting. <br><br>

With proof of vaccination, California residents are now allowed to engage in pre-pandemic activities such as indoor dining and concert-going without masks or social distancing. <br><br> For thousands of long haulers, however, the pandemic is far from over. Featuring experts such as Lisa McCorkell, one of the founding members of Patient-Led Research Collaborative; Dr. Bradley Sanville, a pulmonologist working at the Post COVID-19 Clinic at UC Davis; and Laura Stock, Director of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of California, Berkeley, this episode delves into what exactly long COVID, or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, entails and what research is being done and what this implies for the future of work and wellbeing.

However, overdoing this analysis of the “parasite” metaphor to describe living in poverty would dehumanize individuals living at or below the poverty threshold.

Who are some of the large groups of displaced refugees? Why are they residing in long-term camps? What health concerns are there? And, most importantly, how as students and citizens can we help?</p>
