					<br><br>
					Hi y'all! I'm <strong>Jenny</strong> and I use they/them pronouns. I am currently a fourth-year student majoring in <a href = "https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/public-health-ba/curriculum/">Public Health at UC Berkeley</a> and triple-minoring in <a href = "https://journalism.berkeley.edu/programs/summer-minor-program/">Journalism</a>, <a href = "https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-minor">Data Science</a> and <a href = "https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gpp/">Global Poverty & Practice</a>. My passions lie in art; <a href = "https://www.sinsinvalid.org/blog/10-principles-of-disability-justice">disability justice</a>; the prison-military industrial complex (and how academia plays a role in this); LGBTQIA+ identity and rights, AANHPI (Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander) justice; big tech, ethics and policy and the intersections of all of these topics! In the future, I hope to serve local communities either as an investigative data journalist reporting on health-related issues or as an epidemiologist.<br><br>
					Journalism-wise, I interned at the <a href = "https://www.sfpublicpress.org/">San Francisco Public Press</a> during Summer 2021 as a data journalism intern, creating graphics and helping co-report/research stories related to health and housing. On campus, I do public health-specific reporting with and copy edit for <a href = "https://pha.berkeley.edu/">the Public Health Advocate</a> and am working on my first project as a data journalist on <a href = "https://dailycal-projects.tumblr.com/">the Daily Californian's Projects team</a>. Before coming to the Daily Cal, I designed for <a href = "https://therightsstuff.org/">The Rights Stuff</a> (check out their <a href = "https://issuu.com/rightsstuff/docs/the_rights_stuff_-_spring_2020_issue">Spring '20 issue</a> - I designed the cover!) and <a href = "https://bpr.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Political Review</a>. 
					<br><br>
					Outside of designing graphics or layouts, fiddling with D3 or reporting, I served as a student coordinator and web designer/developer for <a href = "https://aapihrg.wordpress.com/">AAPIHRG</a>, or the Asian American & Pacific Islander Health Research Group, mentoring students on their research projects on AAPI-related health issues. I engaged in human-centered design as <a href = "https://fungfellows.berkeley.edu/fellows/2020-21-health-track/">a Health + Tech Fung Fellow</a>, learning how to conduct user interviews and engage in rapid prototyping, feedback and iteration. I was a also former research assistant at <a href = "https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/programs-projects/tech/investigations-lab">the Human Rights Investigative Lab</a> at the Human Rights Center, where I helped fact-check and collect data for various projects on health and human rights-related issues.

					<br><br>
					Fun facts: I love learning languages - I can speak some Spanish and Korean, and I'm currently trying to learn ASL (American Sign Language). I'm also very interested in electronic music production and run a regularly updated Spotify playlist called <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1xhTWESvAZj3SxkXGrd5ut?si=8rTfZ_BDT7aoAlhEv29vLg">slide into my E'DM's</a>. Give it a listen and please reach out if you're also interested in EDM or if you think a song should be added/removed!

With proof of vaccination, California residents are now allowed to engage in pre-pandemic activities such as indoor dining and concert-going without masks or social distancing. <br><br> For thousands of long haulers, however, the pandemic is far from over. Featuring experts such as Lisa McCorkell, one of the founding members of Patient-Led Research Collaborative; Dr. Bradley Sanville, a pulmonologist working at the Post COVID-19 Clinic at UC Davis; and Laura Stock, Director of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of California, Berkeley, this episode delves into what exactly long COVID, or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, entails and what research is being done and what this implies for the future of work and wellbeing. <br><br><i>Programs/Tools used: Adobe Premiere Pro, Audacity, Zoom H1n Handy Microphone, Blue Yeti USB Microphone</i></p>

In <span lang = "kr">기생충</span>, or “Parasite,” the word itself represents many aspects of the characters and storyline, and the symbolism of its title is a significant contributor to the dual metaphorical-yet-concrete nature of Parasite. To a certain extent, Director Bong Joon Ho uses the metaphor of the parasite to convey the concrete, harsh reality of poverty. However, overdoing this analysis of the “parasite” metaphor to describe living in poverty would dehumanize individuals living at or below the poverty threshold. It also raises an uncomfortable question: Do we ourselves view individuals living at or below the poverty threshold as parasites?</p>

Who are some of the large groups of displaced refugees? Why are they residing in long-term camps? What health concerns are there? And, most importantly, how as students and citizens can we help?</p>
