						<h3>High-Risk CA Residents May Be Eligible for COVID-19 Vaccine</h3>

						<p><img class = "article-picture" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwonjs/kwonjs.github.io/main/HighRiskCalifornia_Header.png">On February 11, 2021, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) updated their guidelines on allocating COVID-19 vaccines to include high-risk individuals. Starting on March 15, healthcare providers ‚Äúmay use their clinical judgment‚Äù to vaccinate 16 to 64-year-old individuals at the highest risk of complications or death from COVID-19 who have at least one of the ‚Äúsevere health conditions‚Äù or a ‚Äúdevelopmental or other severe high-risk disability‚Äù listed on CDPH‚Äôs provider bulletin. These severe health conditions include cancer, chronic kidney disease (stage 4 or above), oxygen-dependent chronic pulmonary disease, down syndrome, weakened immune system due to organ transplant, pregnancy, sickle cell disease, certain heart conditions, severe obesity and type 2 diabetes. <br><br>These revisions in the vaccine rollout plan stem from immense pushback from disabled citizens and advocates after Governor Gavin Newsom announced on January 25 that California would be switching from a plan that prioritized both healthcare workers and ‚Äúpeople at increased risk for severe illness or death from COVID-19‚Äù in Phase 1 to an age-based vaccination eligibility framework. In the press release, Governor Newsom‚Äôs office stated that the change in vaccine distribution would be ‚Äúsimplifying and standardizing‚Äù the process, even though this new plan would leave out younger disabled individuals who are at higher risk of getting COVID-19. The collective response from disabled communities and leaders was swift. </p>

In <span lang = "kr">Í∏∞ÏÉùÏ∂©</span>, or ‚ÄúParasite,‚Äù the word itself represents many aspects of the characters and storyline, and the symbolism of its title is a significant contributor to the dual metaphorical-yet-concrete nature of Parasite. To a certain extent, Director Bong Joon Ho uses the metaphor of the parasite to convey the concrete, harsh reality of poverty...However, overdoing this analysis of the ‚Äúparasite‚Äù metaphor to describe living in poverty would dehumanize individuals living at or below the poverty threshold. It also raises an uncomfortable question: Do we ourselves view individuals living at or below the poverty threshold as parasites?</p>

The image text reads, "As a former health insurance exec, I don't think any story better illustrates my old industry's racket than the one I'm about to tell you: Right now, as we enter the worst public health crisis of our lifetimes (#COVID19), health insurers are still raking in record profits."

						<p><img class = "article-picture" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwonjs/kwonjs.github.io/main/disability-visibility.png"><i>Disability Visibility</i> was revolutionary in putting disabled voices and dreams into modern mainstream media. I illustrated my interpretation of six stories that touched me and impacted my view of what constitutes disability justice and what is needed to create a kinder and more accessible world. These stories include: "Six Ways of Looking at Crip Time" by Ellen Samuels, "The Beauty of Spaces Created for and by Disabled People" by s.e. smith, "How to Make a Paper Crane from Rage" by Elsa Sjunneson, "Nurturing Black Disabled Joy" by Keah Brown, "I am too pretty for Ugly Laws" (a poem by Lateef McLeod embedded in the story "Gaining Power through Communication Access"), and "I'm Tired of Chasing a Cure" by Liz Moore. Click the link above to view these illustrations in a keyboard accessible carousel/gallery and read more on my interpretations of them. <br><br> <a href = "https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/">Click here to go to the Disability Visibility Project website run by Alice Wong.</a></p>
