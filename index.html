					Hi y'all! I'm <strong>Jenny</strong> and I use they/them pronouns. Currently, I'm a graphics reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle! I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I majored in <a href = "https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/public-health-ba/curriculum/">Public Health</a> and minored in <a href = "https://journalism.berkeley.edu/programs/summer-minor-program/">Journalism</a>, <a href = "https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-minor">Data Science</a> and <a href = "https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gpp/">Global Poverty & Practice</a>. My passions lie in art; <a href = "https://www.sinsinvalid.org/blog/10-principles-of-disability-justice">disability justice</a>; the prison-military industrial complex (and how academia plays a role in this); LGBTQIA+ identity and rights, AANHPI (Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander) justice; big tech, ethics and policy and the intersections of all of these topics.<br><br>
					Prior to working at The Chronicle, I interned at <a href = "https://www.seattletimes.com">The Seattle Times</a> as a graphics intern during Summer 2022 and the <a href = "https://www.sfpublicpress.org">San Francisco Public Press</a> during Summer 2021 as a data journalism intern, creating graphics and helping co-report/research stories related to health and housing. My first official data journalism stint (and brief foray into feature writing and copy editing) was in Spring 2021 with <a href = "https://www.infonile.org">InfoNile</a>, a geodata journalism initiative based in Kampala, Uganda. the Since 2022, I have served as a volunteer at the Asian American Journalism Association Conference.  
					<!-- On campus, I did public health-specific reporting with and copy-edited for <a href = "https://pha.berkeley.edu/">the Public Health Advocate</a>, worked as a data journalist on <a href = "https://dailycal-projects.tumblr.com/">the Daily Californian's Projects team</a> and designed for <a href = "https://therightsstuff.org/">The Rights Stuff</a> (check out their <a href = "https://issuu.com/rightsstuff/docs/the_rights_stuff_-_spring_2020_issue">Spring '20 issue</a> - I designed the cover!) and <a href = "https://bpr.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Political Review</a>. 
					<br><br>
					Outside of designing graphics or layouts, fiddling with D3 or reporting, I served as a student coordinator and web designer/developer for <a href = "https://aapihrg.wordpress.com/">AAPIHRG</a>, or the Asian American & Pacific Islander Health Research Group, mentoring students on their research projects on AAPI-related health issues. I engaged in human-centered design as <a href = "https://fungfellows.berkeley.edu/fellows/2020-21-health-track/">a Health + Tech Fung Fellow</a>, learning how to conduct user interviews and engage in rapid prototyping, feedback and iteration. I was a also former research assistant at <a href = "https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/programs-projects/tech/investigations-lab">the Human Rights Investigative Lab</a> at the Human Rights Center, where I helped fact-check and collect data for various projects on health and human rights-related issues.  -->

					Fun facts: I love learning languages - I can speak some Spanish and Korean, and I'm currently learning ASL (American Sign Language) and Mandarin. I'm also very interested in electronic music production and run a regularly updated Spotify playlist called <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1xhTWESvAZj3SxkXGrd5ut?si=8rTfZ_BDT7aoAlhEv29vLg">slide into my E'DM's</a>.

Due to the scaling back of virus tracking efforts nationwide, scientists and public health experts — including those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — have turned to monitoring the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 particles found in wastewater at sewage treatment plants as a more dependable metric for community-level infection rates. This tracker pulls data daily and  displays data on the most recent and historic levels of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations at 12 Bay Area wastewater plants using WastewaterSCAN's API.

Their departments disagree, but still erase their misconduct and award them lifetime disability pensions. Under California law, police agencies are forbidden from dangling disability pensions as an inducement to rid themselves of problem officers. But an investigation by the San Francisco Chronicle and UC Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program identified 49 officers across the state who, on the verge of being ousted for alleged misconduct, were allowed to walk away with their wrongdoing hidden and collect lifetime disability pensions for injuries their own employers had challenged as unsubstantiated.<br><br>

Huge swaths of forest have been wiped out, forcing thousands to flee and choking many more with smoke. But here's a fact that may seem surprising: Even more of the California landscape used to be on fire. Before the 1800s, when Europeans flooding into California outlawed fires set by Native Americans, at least 4.5 million acres — and sometimes up to 12 million acres — burned in California every year, according to UC Berkeley researchers.<br><br>That figure has only one modern equivalent: 2020.

As food costs skyrocket and inflation hits record highs, even for wholesalers, Costco will hold steady on its iconic dog-and-drink deal. The combo has cost $1.50 since it first arrived in food courts in 1985, even though the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator says it’s worth more than $4 today.

However, overdoing this analysis of the “parasite” metaphor to describe living in poverty would dehumanize individuals living at or below the poverty threshold. It also raises an uncomfortable question: Do we ourselves view individuals living at or below the poverty threshold as parasites?</p>
